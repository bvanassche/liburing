From the kernel documentation file refcount-vs-atomic.rst:

A RELEASE memory ordering guarantees that all prior loads and
stores (all po-earlier instructions) on the same CPU are completed
before the operation. It also guarantees that all po-earlier
stores on the same CPU and all propagated stores from other CPUs
must propagate to all other CPUs before the release operation
(A-cumulative property). This is implemented using
:c:func:`smp_store_release`.

An ACQUIRE memory ordering guarantees that all post loads and
stores (all po-later instructions) on the same CPU are
completed after the acquire operation. It also guarantees that all
po-later stores on the same CPU must propagate to all other CPUs
after the acquire operation executes. This is implemented using
:c:func:`smp_acquire__after_ctrl_dep`.
